			<p>"As the Website Development Program Coordinator and Associate Professor at RACC, Brian challenges his students to not only learn technology but to also take a hard look inside themselves to see who they really are and realize their hidden potential.  He wants to give them the same motivation he was given when he was student. â€œI will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in students by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life and a satisfaction of self-worth."
